## What is Waymaker

WayMaker was conceptualized out of my need to find musicians to play for my church Band.
I thought that it would be nice to have a platform for church music programs to post jobs online.


### Users
For this app there are two types of users. Churches and Musicians.
Each type of user has their own privilages. 
Such as wall post, Only churches can post their content on the wall. But, only musicians can comment on the wall Post.

E.G-2: Job postings, only Churches can post a job, and only musicians can apply for the jobs.


### Goals of this app

My goal was to get better with conditional rendering and a base understanding of Context in react.
Due to the different types of users, the app is filled with many conditional rendering that you would find in most mainstream applications.
